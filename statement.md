# Problem statement
The use of streaming and software subscriptions makes it difficult for individuals to track total monthly spending and manage personal budgets. The core problem is that users often forget active services, leading to unexpected recurring costs. This project addresses this by developing a simple, single-session Python CLI tool to allow individual users to track, view, and calculate all their subscription expenses instantly.

# Scope of the project
Scope of the Project
The scope defines exactly what the Subscription Manager program is built to do, and what it is not built to do.
1. Application Type
a)Command-Line Interface (CLI): The program works only as a text-based tool. It does not have a graphical interface with buttons and windows.
2. User and Session Limit
a) Single-User Focus: The tool is designed to manage the subscriptions of only one individual user. It does not support multiple users or profiles.
b) Single-Session Use: The application is limited to a single running session.
3. Data Storage
a)In-Memory Storage: All data (subscription names and costs) is stored temporarily in the computer's memory (RAM) while the program is running.
4. Functionality
The scope includes the following core functions:
a)Adding: Allowing the user to input a new subscription name and its monthly cost.
b)Deleting: Allowing the user to remove a subscription by entering its name.
c)Viewing: Displaying the full list of currently active subscriptions.
d)Aggregation: Calculating and showing the total combined monthly cost of all active subscriptions.
